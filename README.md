# 🕒 The Indian Time

**The Indian Time** is a minimalist digital clock made with plain JavaScript. It shows the **current local time in IST (Indian Standard Time)** in a **24-hour format** using the built-in `Date` object.

## ✨ Features

- Displays **current time in 24-hour format**
- Uses JavaScript's native `Date` object
- No external libraries or time zone conversions
- Simple and lightweight – just HTML, CSS, and JS

> ⚠️ This clock assumes the **system time zone is set to IST**. It does not perform manual time zone adjustments.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Download or clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/the-indian-time.git
   cd the-indian-time
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

That's it! The clock will start showing the current time in IST (if your system clock is set to IST).
